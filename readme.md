# Book-separator

A Processing program generating typography-based book separators.

Since precise font-size selection proved to be very tricky, a second scrip is included, font_calibration, which helps determine the actual many heights of fonts (ascent, caps height, x-height, descent...)

## Fonts

Candidates were selected for their (perceived) relative importance, not on aesthetics. This is why you have Comic Sans in the list.
There clearly is a bias towards recent font, those that were bundled with computers ever since the mid 90s but even more so towards those that were part of the web font package and that were therefore massively used all over the internet before the advent of broadband web fonts and which shaped the world we read every day.

I tried to include diversified fonts : display fonts, serif and sans-serif, monospaced
Code / Newspaper / Web / Magazines / Graphic art /
